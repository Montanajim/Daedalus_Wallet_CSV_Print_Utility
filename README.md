### Daedalus_Wallet_CSV_Print_Utility

Daedalus Wallet - A python print script to print your Daedalus wallet(s) as a csv

Platform: Windows

Tested on Daedalus Mainnet 2.2.0

This is a python script to output your Daedalus wallet(s) as a csv file.  One should always double check the output with the Daedalus wallet.  The wallets print in the order of their wallet id and not their wallet name.  Also be aware that the script has to get the tansaction time from the blockchain as it was not stored locally. So, it may take a little bit of time.

Use at your own risk. No warranties are express or implied.  This was just a little side project of mine.

Enjoy!
